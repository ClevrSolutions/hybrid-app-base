# Mendix PhoneGap Build app base package

This repository contains the core files needed to build a Phonegap package for your Mendix application.
It consists of two main parts:

- The core source files for the Hybrid app
- The webpack configuration that is used during the build process

You should not use this package directly.
Instead, refer to the Mendix Phonegap Build app template for instructions on how to customize and build your Mendix Hybrid mobile app.
