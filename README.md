# Mendix PhoneGap / Cordova hybrid app base package

This repository contains the core files needed to build a Phonegap package for your Mendix application.
It consists of two main parts:

- The core source files for the hybrid app
- The webpack configuration that is used during the build process

You should not use this package directly.
Instead, refer to the [Mendix PhoneGap / Cordova hybrid app template](https://github.com/mendix/hybrid-app-template/) for instructions on how to customize and build your Mendix hybrid mobile app.
